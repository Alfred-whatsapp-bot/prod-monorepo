# Alfred Bot Container (prod-monorepo)

This project contains the Alfred Bot backend with the Business Control Platform/Plataforma de Controle do Neg√≥cio (BCP/PCN).
Both together are the problem solver that SMBs and sellers can use to make their businesses even bigger.


## Getting Started

Enter the directory backend and run on Bash:
    
    npm install
    
And repeat to the frontend directory.

After that you need to use the Bash terminal to run these commands:

Terminal 1 (backend directory):

    npm run dev 

Terminal 2 (backend directory):

    npm run api:dev:detach

terminal 3 (frontend directory):

    npm start

And then, finally you can have fun!
